# Baird-Aromaticity
Exploring Baird Aromaticity in Azaboracyclooctatetraenes through new descritors based on the Distributed Multipole Analysis (DMA)
In this repository, you will find the geometries of the ground state and first triplet state of various systems. Single-point calculations were performed using the B3LYP//6-311G(d,p) method with the Gaussian16 software. The data generated from these calculations are also included in this repository. Additionally, the repository contains an Excel file with data obtained through the GDMA2 software for the mentioned systems. All analysis results, as well as the formatted checkpoint files, are available for review. We hope this work is helpful for your research. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to contact us. Best regards, Theoretical Chemistry Group Military Institute of Engineering (IME) Rio de Janeiro, Brazil We wish you the best of luck in your studies and research!
